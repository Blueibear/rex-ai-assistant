## Rex 2.0 Capability Backlog

### AI Provenance & Watermark

**Status:** Planned; implement after the canonical Rex 2.0 capability/action path is stable. Do not implement as a legacy direct-execution `plugins/skills/*.py` mutation path.

**Design:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-13-ai-provenance-watermark-design.md`

**Upstream baseline:** `guillaumemeyer/watermarks-remover` v0.4.0, commit `c267d785e8c09856bb2f9316ea8de3064651fe79`. Pin the exact upstream commit; do not execute an unreviewed moving `main`/`latest`.

**Prerequisites:**
- [ ] Canonical capability retrieval/routing is the production path for discoverable Rex abilities.
- [ ] File-writing operations execute through the canonical action lifecycle, including authorization, cancellation, audit, and verification.
- [ ] Request-level failure/recovery semantics are stable enough to classify unavailable optional backends without false success.
- [ ] External capability/dependency health can be represented truthfully as unavailable, degraded, ready, or optional rather than assumed healthy.

**Tier 1 - deterministic inspection and cleaning (default):**
- [ ] Add `AI Provenance & Watermark` as a Rex 2.0 capability with natural-language routing.
- [ ] Support unified inspect/clean for PNG, JPEG, SVG, PDF, DOCX, ODT, HTML, Markdown, and text.
- [ ] Support invisible Unicode hygiene, C2PA/Content Credentials, EXIF, XMP, document/container metadata, directory audits, and website/sitemap audits.
- [ ] Inspect before mutation and re-inspect the output after mutation.
- [ ] Preserve originals by default and write `*.cleaned.*` outputs unless the user explicitly requests an in-place operation and policy allows it.
- [ ] Keep deterministic findings separate from probable/informational/false-positive findings.
- [ ] Never claim removal was verified unless the post-clean inspection provides evidence for that specific marker/container.

**Tier 2 - statistical text-watermark reduction (optional per request):**
- [ ] Add Layer B rewrite support through Rex's existing request-local LLM routing rather than a mandatory new paid provider.
- [ ] Prefer a rewrite model different from the suspected source model when practical.
- [ ] Preserve facts, numbers, names, technical identifiers, and user-requested meaning constraints.
- [ ] Run deterministic text hygiene again after rewriting.
- [ ] Report statistical watermark reduction as best-effort; never claim official vendor-detector success without an official detector/key.

**Tier 3 - pixel-domain image watermark support (optional/heavy):**
- [ ] Support optional reverse-SynthID scoring as an external, non-bundled detection backend.
- [ ] Support optional CtrlRegen/noai-watermark removal as an external, non-bundled regeneration backend.
- [ ] Keep reverse-SynthID and CtrlRegen outside the AskRex repository and outside the default Rex install because of their separate licensing and heavy dependencies.
- [ ] Default CtrlRegen strength to `0.25`; expose documented presets only with clear regeneration/quality tradeoffs.
- [ ] Report before/after scoring when available, while clearly identifying reverse-SynthID as unofficial and best-effort.
- [ ] Treat GPU/model/Hugging Face/backend absence as an optional-component state, not a Rex failure.
- [ ] Do not download the ~10 GB Tier 3 model payload until the user installs/enables that optional component.

**Security, supply-chain, and licensing:**
- [ ] Pin and review upstream revisions before updating the integration.
- [ ] Add compatibility tests before advancing the upstream pin.
- [ ] Keep API/Hugging Face tokens in Rex's credential/vault path or environment-only handoff; never put secrets on command-line arguments or in logs.
- [ ] Preserve the licensing boundary: watermarks-remover is MIT; reverse-SynthID remains external under its upstream non-commercial research terms; CtrlRegen/noai-watermark remains external and must not be vendored while it lacks a permissive license.
- [ ] Apply Rex path/symlink/output-boundary protections to all file mutations.

**Verification and tests:**
- [ ] Test skill/capability routing and unsupported formats.
- [ ] Test binary-vs-text refusal and original-file preservation.
- [ ] Test Unicode, C2PA, EXIF/XMP, PDF, DOCX, ODT, HTML/Markdown inspection/cleaning paths.
- [ ] Test post-clean verification and no-false-success behavior.
- [ ] Test rewrite backend failure/degradation and semantic-preservation constraints.
- [ ] Mock Tier 3 heavy model execution in normal CI; do not download multi-gigabyte models in standard GitHub Actions.
- [ ] Test missing GPU, missing external checkout, model-download failure, timeout, cancellation, symlink/path traversal, and permission denial.
- [ ] Add an explicit optional-component integration test procedure for a real GPU-equipped development machine.


## Controlled Self-Maintenance and Capability Acquisition

### Status Rule
- [x] means current code plus tests/evidence verify the entire checklist item.
- [ ] means missing, only partially implemented, or not yet reconciled against current `master`.
- Do not rebuild an existing component under a second architecture. Reuse and harden the foundations below.

### Verified Existing Foundations to Reuse
- [x] Rex skill registry exists and persists registered skills
- [x] Rex skill router exists and can route matching skill requests
- [x] Rex skill trainer detects natural-language skill-creation requests and creates/registers skill scaffolds
- [x] Rex developer tooling can apply unified-diff code patches
- [x] Rex developer tooling can run pytest and return structured test results
- [x] Rex GitHub service supports issues, pull requests, commits, and local branch patch workflows
- [x] Rex policy/audit infrastructure exists and must be reused for maintenance actions
- [x] OpenClaw HTTP integration exists as an optional external capability provider

### Capability Gap Resolver
- [ ] Add a canonical capability-gap result model and decision trace
- [ ] Check Rex's native tool/capability registry first
- [ ] Check enabled local skills second
- [ ] Check approved OpenClaw/ClawHub capabilities third
- [ ] Filter every path through current user/privacy/context/disclosure authority before selection
- [ ] Choose local skill generation when the capability can remain modular
- [ ] Escalate to core-code modification only when a skill/plugin cannot safely satisfy the request
- [ ] Surface why Rex selected each capability-acquisition path
- [ ] Add tests for each resolution path and fail-closed behavior

### Functional Skill Generation
- [ ] Extend generated skills beyond honest scaffolds into real implementations when safe
- [ ] Generate explicit permission metadata for each new skill
- [ ] Generate verification behavior for mutating skills
- [ ] Generate or require tests before enabling a new skill
- [ ] Lint/typecheck/test generated skill code before registration as enabled
- [ ] Keep newly generated skills disabled when validation fails
- [ ] Add rollback/disable behavior for a skill that later fails health checks
- [ ] Prevent generated skills from silently expanding their own permissions
- [ ] Prevent generated skills from widening contextual-use, disclosure, upload scope/audience, `location_assist`, or person-specific `location_share`

### Developer Agent and Isolated Workspace
- [ ] Create a canonical self-maintenance/developer-agent entry point
- [ ] Resolve the AskRex source checkout safely and refuse packaged-runtime mutation when no source checkout is available
- [ ] Create a dedicated branch and Git worktree for every code-changing maintenance task
- [ ] Prevent direct edits/commits to protected `master`
- [ ] Reproduce the reported defect before modifying code when reasonably possible
- [ ] Require a root-cause statement and proposed validation plan before patching
- [ ] Reuse `VSCodeService`/developer tools rather than adding a duplicate patch/test service
- [ ] Run targeted tests first, then the required broader validation gates
- [ ] Inspect the final diff for unexpected scope before PR creation
- [ ] Preserve the working production/runtime version until a replacement is verified

### Canonical Maintenance Safety Lifecycle
- [ ] Route code mutation through the canonical policy/execution lifecycle
- [ ] Honor both `allowed` and `requires_approval` decisions at the actual execution boundary
- [ ] Require short-lived confirmation for maintenance actions classified as requiring approval
- [ ] Record issue/request, plan, files changed, commands run, test results, PR, merge, deployment, and verification in audit history
- [ ] Distinguish proposed, attempted, completed, verified, failed, rolled_back, and blocked states
- [ ] Fail closed if the verification path is unavailable for a high-impact change

### Rex GitHub Maintainer Identity
- [ ] Create a dedicated least-privilege GitHub App or equivalent machine identity for Rex
- [ ] Restrict installation to explicitly approved repositories, initially `Blueibear/AskRex-Assistant` only
- [ ] Grant only repository permissions required for issues, contents/branches, pull requests, and check/status visibility
- [ ] Grant workflow-file write permission only if explicitly required and separately approved
- [ ] Do not use a personal GitHub token as Rex's long-term maintainer identity
- [ ] Prevent Rex from increasing its own GitHub permissions or installation scope
- [ ] Prevent Rex from deleting the repository or bypassing protected-branch/ruleset requirements
- [ ] Store GitHub App credentials in the canonical credential vault
- [ ] Add GitHub App health/status reporting

### Automated Repository Maintenance
- [ ] Let Rex create and triage issues for verified defects
- [ ] Let Rex create maintenance branches/worktrees
- [ ] Let Rex commit and push bounded changes to its maintenance branch
- [ ] Let Rex open/update pull requests with evidence and validation results
- [ ] Monitor required GitHub checks and diagnose failures
- [ ] Allow Rex to iterate on its own PR when checks fail
- [ ] Merge automatically only when policy permits and every required gate is green
- [ ] Keep releases separate from merge when deployment risk requires an additional gate
- [ ] Synchronize completed maintenance work with active PRD/checklist documentation when required

### Protected Constitutional Controls
- [ ] Define a canonical protected-file/policy list
- [ ] Require explicit owner approval for changes that increase Rex's authority
- [ ] Require explicit owner approval for GitHub App permission/scope changes
- [ ] Require explicit owner approval for branch-protection/ruleset weakening
- [ ] Require explicit owner approval for self-maintenance policy/approval changes
- [ ] Require explicit owner approval for changes that weaken required CI/security gates
- [ ] Treat contextual-use, disclosure, upload private/household scope/audience, `location_assist`, and person-specific `location_share` as protected per-user authority
- [ ] Require the appropriate affected user/data-owner authorization to widen privacy/context authority; household/admin status cannot override another user's location grants
- [ ] Ensure Rex, generated skills, OpenClaw capabilities, and maintenance agents cannot approve their own broader privacy/context authority
- [ ] Require elevated review for credential-vault, authentication, update, rollback, and verification code
- [ ] Ensure Rex cannot approve its own authority-expanding change

### Safe Self-Update, Deployment, and Rollback
- [ ] Define a versioned update package or checkout activation mechanism
- [ ] Capture the last-known-good version before activation
- [ ] Run pre-activation validation on the candidate version
- [ ] Restart/reload only the minimum required services
- [ ] Perform post-activation health and functional smoke verification
- [ ] Automatically roll back when health verification fails
- [ ] Verify rollback success independently
- [ ] Report the running commit/version after update or rollback
- [ ] Never replace the only known-good copy of Rex during self-update

### Maintenance Observability and GUI
- [ ] Show active maintenance task and trigger/source
- [ ] Show current branch/worktree and changed files
- [ ] Show tests/checks and their states
- [ ] Show approval requests and reasons
- [ ] Show GitHub issue/PR/check/merge state
- [ ] Show deployed/running commit and rollback target
- [ ] Provide an emergency disable switch for autonomous maintenance
- [ ] Provide per-user permission controls for requesting or approving maintenance

### End-to-End Verification
- [ ] Test a missing capability resolved by an existing Rex tool
- [ ] Test a missing capability resolved through an approved external skill/plugin
- [ ] Test a missing capability implemented as a generated local skill
- [ ] Test a real low-risk Rex code defect diagnosed and fixed in an isolated worktree
- [ ] Test failed validation preventing PR/merge/deploy
- [ ] Test required owner approval blocking a constitutional/safety change
- [ ] Test an attempted privacy-authority widening remains blocked until the affected user/data-owner authorizes it
- [ ] Test green PR checks allowing an authorized merge
- [ ] Test failed post-update health check causing automatic rollback
- [ ] Test that Rex reports only verified maintenance outcomes as successful

### Rollout Policy
- [ ] Keep self-maintenance disabled by default until the production-readiness release candidate is complete
- [ ] Enable read-only diagnosis first
- [ ] Enable issue/PR creation next
- [ ] Enable low-risk branch changes after repeated successful supervised trials
- [ ] Enable bounded auto-merge only after independent CI and rollback testing are proven
- [ ] Keep authority-changing operations permanently owner-gated
- [ ] Keep per-user privacy/context authority changes permanently affected-user/data-owner-gated

## US-123 Situational Context / Privacy / Proactivity Acceptance

- [x] Canonical source-policy metadata and content-free revision invalidation implemented.
- [x] Connected-source contextual use remains separate from mutation/disclosure authority.
- [x] Uploaded documents support independent future-context inclusion and private/household audience policy.
- [x] Current/recent personal location requires owner-controlled `location_assist`.
- [x] Person-specific location disclosure requires separate owner-controlled `location_share`.
- [x] Household/admin/OpenClaw/generated-skill/self-maintenance status cannot widen another user's privacy grants.
- [x] Bounded expiring active-context references support authorized natural follow-ups and clarify ambiguity.
- [x] Proactive opportunities are source-grounded, freshness-aware, user-scoped, high-signal, and dismissal-aware.
- [x] Electron Context & Privacy Settings and authenticated mobile settings use the same owner-bound service.
- [x] Proactive assistance disabled state short-circuits before proactive private/current-info reads.
- [x] Focused US-123 matrix passed 596/596 tests on 2026-08-22.
- [x] Context/privacy + output-routing GUI validation passed 8/8 tests, TypeScript typecheck, and production build.
- [x] Ruff, Black, mypy, release security audit, repository truth/integrity tests, pre-commit, and whitespace checks passed.
- [x] Full `not slow and not audio and not gpu` release matrix executed: 9,325 passed, 65 skipped, and one inherited environment failure because optional `openwakeword` is absent; the same test fails on master and the three `master..origin/master` commits do not touch the wake-word test/loader/dependency contract.
- [x] PR #417 implementation head `98c7b224eb6e0a8aadb67cb6071ed7c0a8f7ea11` passed all 18 reported GitHub checks on 2026-08-23; the documentation-only evidence head must remain green before merge.

**Known live-adapter limitation:** proactive weather/traffic/search enrichment is fail-closed and requires an authorized current-info reader. The repository currently has no production traffic reader, so traffic-dependent commute opportunities do not surface live until one is configured.

## Notes

Goal:
Use OpenClaw and ClawHub as the expandable marketplace/tool ecosystem for Rex so that new abilities can be added through OpenClaw plugins and skills without requiring major direct modifications to the Rex codebase.

Architecture Principle:
Rex remains the primary assistant brain responsible for:
- intent routing
- permissions
- safety
- memory
- verification
- final user responses

OpenClaw acts as a modular external tool and capability provider.

Rex 2.0 capability principle:
New capabilities such as AI Provenance & Watermark must plug into the canonical Rex runtime/action lifecycle. A skill may provide discovery and natural-language intent metadata, but mutations must not bypass Rex authorization, verification, audit, cancellation, or user-scoped policy.
