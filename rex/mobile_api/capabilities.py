"""Truthful mobile capability reporting (issue #323).

A feature is ``true`` only when its real backend path exists, its focused
automated tests exist, and its required runtime dependencies are available
right now.  Configuration alone never makes a capability true, and the
response must never expose secrets, file paths, model paths, account IDs,
usernames, or integration tokens.

Session 2 implements chat (HTTP), SSE streaming, WebSocket chat, voice
upload, and TTS.  ``chat``/``chat_streaming`` are code-complete and tested;
``websocket_chat`` additionally requires the validated Flask-Sock stack;
``voice_upload`` requires Whisper + ffmpeg + a locally cached model;
``tts`` requires the configured engine's dependency.

``live_voice``, ``notifications``, ``approvals``, and ``home_assistant``
remain false: their complete server-authoritative mobile paths are not
implemented.  A configured Home Assistant integration alone does not make
the mobile ``home_assistant`` capability true.
