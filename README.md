AskRex Assistant is a local-first AI assistant for text chat, voice interaction, desktop control surfaces, and credential-gated home/productivity integrations. It runs from the Python `rex` package, with optional local ML dependencies for Whisper, openWakeWord, and XTTS, plus optional cloud/local LLM routing through OpenAI-compatible providers and Ollama.

AskRex is a release-candidate implementation under validation, not a signed public production release. The Windows artifact has passed local clean-install, launch, managed-runtime, reinstall, and uninstall automation, but release signing, GitHub CI, and service/hardware checks listed below remain gates. Hold to Talk is the supported voice path; wake word is beta. See [INTEGRATIONS_STATUS.md](INTEGRATIONS_STATUS.md) for integration truth.

## Getting Started

The supported user-facing interface is the **packaged Windows Electron desktop app**. Its managed Voice runtime does not require machine Python, Node.js, a source checkout, or a neighboring virtual environment. The source setup below is for developers; Python 3.11 and Node.js/npm are required only to build or run from source.

Python 3.12 and newer are intentionally rejected by the current installers and runtime checks because the validated ML/TTS dependency path is Python 3.11-only.

1. Clone the repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Blueibear/AskRex-Assistant.git
   cd AskRex-Assistant
   ```

2. Run the install script for your platform.

   Windows PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   py -3.11 -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
   Copy-Item config\rex_config.example.json config\rex_config.json -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
   .\install.ps1
   ```

   macOS/Linux shell:

   ```bash
   python3.11 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
   cp -n config/rex_config.example.json config/rex_config.json
   bash install.sh
   ```

3. Configure LM Studio for local chat completions.

   In LM Studio, load a chat model, start the local OpenAI-compatible server, and confirm the server URL is `http://localhost:1234/v1`. AskRex expects the LM Studio server to be reachable on `localhost:1234` when you choose that local provider path.

4. Run Rex in the Electron desktop app.

   Windows PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   cd gui
   npm.cmd install
   npm.cmd run dev
   ```

   macOS/Linux shell:

   ```bash
   cd gui
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

   The packaged Electron app communicates with Python via IPC bridge scripts. A Flask backend (`rex-gui`) is **not required** at runtime for end users — the Electron app is IPC-only. Run `rex-gui` separately only for developer/operator web-dashboard access.

5. Verify it works.

   ```bash
   rex doctor
   ```

   Then send a short chat message in the Electron app and confirm Rex replies.

## Install

This section states which install method serves which audience. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for detailed per-audience instructions.

**End users — packaged Windows Electron installer:** The built release artifact contains its own managed Python 3.11 Voice runtime, installed AskRex wheel, bridge scripts, and FFmpeg. It does not require a separate `pip install`, Node.js, or machine Python. The current local release candidate is unsigned; public release signing remains an external release requirement.

**Developers and operators — `pip install .` from source:** `pip install .` installs the Python library (`rex` package), all six console scripts (`rex`, `rex-gui`, `rex-config`, `rex-speak-api`, `rex-agent`, `rex-tool-server`), the IPC bridge scripts (`bridge/rex_*.py` → `{sys.prefix}/bridge/`) that the Electron app spawns at runtime, and the config example (`config/rex_config.example.json` → `{sys.prefix}/config/`). This is the correct install path for developers, contributors, and operators who need CLI access, voice loop, TTS API, or direct Python library access. It does **not** provide the Electron desktop installer. See the [Advanced / Developer](#advanced--developer) section and [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for the full developer setup.

The `askrex-assistant` PyPI package, when published, targets the **developer/operator** audience. It is not an end-user install artifact.

## Current Status

This README reflects the current milestone after recent live testing and repair work. The Electron GUI is the current primary user-facing interface. The repo has usable CLI, chat, GUI, Home Assistant, and voice paths, with several areas still being stabilized.

## Working Now

- Core CLI help and doctor paths work: `rex --help`, `rex doctor`, and `python -m rex doctor`.
- Basic text chat works in the CLI and GUI.
- The Electron GUI launches and the main shell is stable.
- GUI pages load for Tasks, Reminders, Settings, Users, Integrations, Email, Calendar, and Home Assistant.
- The Home Assistant page loads and lists entities after the recent GUI/backend consistency fixes.
- The Home Assistant status stays authenticated in the UI after a successful live API test; saved credentials alone remain configured-only.
- GUI Chat shows a visible pending/thinking state while Rex is preparing a reply.
- Voice Hold to Talk records, transcribes, streams a Rex reply, synthesizes and plays it on the configured output device, supports cancel/barge-in and replay, and can be used repeatedly.
- Wake-word mode is wired but remains beta; it is not part of the release-verified voice contract.
- Custom wake backends are wired: built-in openWakeWord fallback, `custom_embedding` as an interim path, and `custom_onnx` as the long-term target when a real asset is present.
- Day/date phrasing coverage in chat has improved for common variants.

## Known Limitations / External Verification

- Wake-word mode is beta and still requires microphone/device reliability and latency validation.
- The repo does not ship a real `Hey Rex` custom wake asset. A valid asset is still required for `custom_onnx` or `custom_embedding` to become active.
- Outlook email and calendar are labeled unavailable because Graph OAuth is not implemented.
- Some pages and integrations are still in active stabilization; do not assume every registered integration is production-ready.
- The locally built Windows installer is unsigned. Signing remains a public-release gate.
- Microphone input, audible selected-output TTS, barge-in, live Home Assistant transitions, and provider delivery/write paths require environment-specific validation.

## Implemented Privacy Boundary

Electron resolves one validated session identity in the main process. Chat, history, memories, tasks, reminders, shopping, email/calendar/SMS reads, voice identity, corrections, and document uploads receive that identity explicitly and fail closed when it is missing or invalid. Existing unowned Electron data is quarantined by `scripts/migrate_electron_data_ownership.py`; data is shared only when an owning store explicitly marks it shared. See [docs/security/ELECTRON_IDENTITY_AND_DATA.md](docs/security/ELECTRON_IDENTITY_AND_DATA.md).

## Main Entry Points

| Surface | Command | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Electron desktop app** | Installed AskRex app; source development: `cd gui; npm.cmd run dev` | **Primary user-facing interface** — Windows artifact is locally validated but unsigned |
| CLI text chat | `rex` or `python -m rex` | Working basic chat (developer / advanced) |
| Diagnostics | `rex doctor` or `python -m rex doctor` | Working |
| Voice loop | `python rex_loop.py` | Developer / advanced source path; wake word is beta |
| Python/Flask local API | `rex-gui` | Developer-only compatibility/API surface; not spawned or required by Electron |
| TTS API | `rex-speak-api` | Implemented service, default `127.0.0.1:5005` (developer / advanced) |
| OpenClaw tool server | `rex-tool-server` | Implemented service, default `127.0.0.1:18790` (developer / advanced) |
| Windows computer agent | `rex-agent` | Optional remote PC control agent (developer / advanced) |
| Runtime config CLI | `rex-config` | Config inspection and legacy env migration (developer / advanced) |

The Electron app under `gui/` is the current primary GUI. `rex-gui` remains useful as a local Flask/API service and for compatibility testing, but its browser dashboard at `/ui/` is incomplete and should not be treated as the main user interface. The legacy Tkinter launchers (`gui.py` and its entry point) are archived — moved to `archived/tkinter_gui/` and no longer maintained. See [SURFACE-CLASSIFICATION.md](SURFACE-CLASSIFICATION.md).

## Features

| Area | Current repo state |
|---|---|
| Text chat | Basic CLI and GUI chat work through `rex.assistant.Assistant` and the configured LLM provider. Common day/date phrasing coverage has improved; provider quality still depends on model/configuration. |
| Voice pipeline | Hold to Talk is the supported production path: record, Whisper STT, streamed response, TTS, selected-device playback, cancel/barge-in, replay, device-loss fallback, and repeated turns. Wake-word mode remains beta while hardware reliability and latency are still being tuned. |
| Custom wake support | Built-in openWakeWord remains the safe fallback path. `custom_embedding` is usable as an interim path, and `custom_onnx` is the target path for a real `Hey Rex` wake model. The repo does not ship that custom asset by default. |
| LLM providers | Local Transformers, OpenAI-compatible API settings, and Ollama routing are supported by config. Local model output quality varies by model and prompt path. |
| Configuration | Runtime settings live in `config/rex_config.json`; secrets live in the OS-backed credential vault; profiles live in `profiles/`. |
| GUIs | The Electron/React desktop GUI (`gui/`) is the current primary interface. The Electron shell is stable in current testing; Tasks, Reminders, Settings, Users, Integrations, Email, Calendar, and Home Assistant pages load. The Python/Flask `rex-gui` surface still serves local API routes and an experimental `/ui/` browser dashboard, but that browser UI is incomplete and not recommended as the primary interface. |
| Home Assistant | The GUI lists entities and routes mutations through one policy service. Sensitive lock/alarm/cover actions require action-bound confirmation, and Rex says an action is confirmed only after observing the requested state; otherwise it reports attempted-but-unverified, denied, or failed. Live-device verification remains environment-dependent. |
| Email and calendar integrations | Credential presence is labeled configured-only. Outlook Graph OAuth is unavailable. The GUI can display inbox/calendar bridge results and create email drafts, but GUI email sending is unavailable; copy the draft into a mail client. |
| CLI integrations | `rex email`, `rex calendar`, `rex msg`, `rex notify`, `rex gh`, `rex code`, `rex pc`, `rex wp`, `rex wc`, `rex ha`, `rex shopping`, `rex usage`, and more are registered. Readiness varies by backend credentials and test coverage. |
| Tool execution | Tool registry, policy checks, audit logging, and OpenClaw-facing HTTP tool server are implemented. Local tool execution currently covers time, weather, and web search; the HTTP tool server exposes a broader adapter set. |
| Memory and private data | Electron private stores are session-identity scoped and tested with two users. Shared data requires explicit shared ownership; legacy unowned data is quarantined for deliberate migration. |
| Notifications | Priority routing, quiet hours, digest/escalation logic, CLI commands, and Electron notification UI plumbing are present. Provider delivery remains externally verified. |
| WordPress/WooCommerce | WordPress health checks and WooCommerce order/product reads are implemented; WooCommerce order status and coupon writes are approval-gated. |
| OpenClaw | Optional experimental HTTP gateway/client adapters and a standalone Rex tool server are present; feature flags under `openclaw` control gateway-backed paths. Configuration does not prove gateway reachability. |

## Requirements

| Component | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Python | Bundled for the Windows end-user artifact; 3.11 only for source/developer workflows |
| OS | Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux |
| FFmpeg | Required for parts of the audio/TTS stack |
| Audio hardware | Microphone and speakers for voice mode |
| Node.js/npm | Build/development only; not required by the installed app |
| GPU | Optional NVIDIA CUDA path via `requirements-gpu*.txt` |

On Windows, use `py -3.11 ...` or activate the repo `.venv` before running commands. A system default `python` that points at 3.12+ will be rejected.

> **Note**: Source voice workflows may require optional audio dependencies. The packaged Voice runtime carries its validated CPU audio/ML stack; do not modify the managed runtime in place.

## Configuration

AskRex uses three configuration layers:

1. `config/rex_config.json` for non-secret runtime settings such as audio, wake word, models, UI, integrations, and feature flags.
2. The Windows DPAPI-backed credential vault for API keys, tokens, passwords, and authentication secrets. Config stores only contextual opaque references.
3. `profiles/<name>.json` for profile-level capabilities and runtime overrides.

The canonical wake word config key is `wakeword`. The legacy `wake_word` key is still migrated at runtime but logs a warning.

Custom wake asset defaults now follow:

- `config/wake_words/hey_rex/model.onnx` for `custom_onnx`
- `config/wake_words/hey_rex/embedding.pt` for `custom_embedding`

The repo wiring is in place for a real custom `Hey Rex` wake path, but a valid asset file is still required before that path becomes active.

Useful config commands:

```bash
rex-config show
rex-config migrate-legacy-env --dry-run
rex-config migrate-legacy-env
```

See [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md), [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md), and [docs/environment-variables.md](docs/environment-variables.md).

For Home Assistant, see [Home Assistant setup](docs/home-assistant-setup.md).

## GUI Usage

See [docs/usage.md](docs/usage.md) for the full usage guide including voice mode, autonomous workflows, and integrations.

### Electron desktop GUI - Windows setup

Use Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
cd gui
npm.cmd install
npm.cmd run dev

## Build and preview the compiled Electron app:
npm.cmd run build
npm.cmd run preview
```

### Electron desktop GUI - macOS setup

Use Terminal:

```bash
cd gui
npm install
npm run dev

npm run build
npm run preview
```

### Flask API backend (`rex-gui`) — developer-only

`rex-gui` starts the Flask server at `http://127.0.0.1:<gui_port>`. It is a **developer-only
backend service** — the packaged Electron app does **not** call it at runtime. All Electron GUI
functionality is backed by IPC bridge scripts (see Quick Start above and
[docs/UI_SURFACES.md](docs/UI_SURFACES.md)).

```bash
rex-gui
## Flask API listens on http://127.0.0.1:8765/ (or configured gui_port)
## Use only for API route testing or the experimental /ui/ browser dashboard
```

Use `rex-gui` only for operator/developer tasks: inspecting API routes, testing bridge scripts
outside Electron, or verifying the Flask layer independently. End users do not need to run it.

## Advanced / Developer

The following runtime paths are for developers, advanced users, and contributors. They are not the primary user-facing path.

### CLI Text Mode

After setting up the Python environment (see [Getting Started](#getting-started) step 2), run:

```bash
rex doctor
rex
```

Configure LM Studio for local model access at `localhost:1234`, or configure an OpenAI-compatible provider in `config/rex_config.json`.

For GPU/CUDA setup and additional install variants, see [docs/advanced-install.md](docs/advanced-install.md). Additional install scripts (`install_full.sh`, `install_lean.sh`, `setup.sh`) are in `scripts/install/`.

### Voice Loop

```bash
python rex_loop.py
```

Wake word → STT → LLM → TTS. Wake-word reliability still requires tuning.

### Common Commands

After activating the virtual environment:

```bash
rex --help
rex doctor
rex tools -v
rex usage
rex memory stats
rex kb search "query"
rex plan "check weather in Dallas"
rex approvals
rex wc orders list --site myshop
rex wc coupons create --site myshop --code SAVE10 --amount 10 --type percent
rex ha tts test --message "Hello from Rex"
```

### TTS API

The TTS API (`rex-speak-api`) requires an API key. Generate one with:

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:REX_SPEAK_API_KEY = "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
$env:REX_ALLOW_PLAINTEXT_CREDENTIAL_FALLBACK = "1"
rex-speak-api  # explicit unpackaged legacy/operator mode; packaged builds reject this
```

macOS/Linux shell:

```bash
export REX_SPEAK_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
export REX_ALLOW_PLAINTEXT_CREDENTIAL_FALLBACK=1
rex-speak-api  # explicit unpackaged legacy/operator mode; no production fallback
```

Request format with curl, using macOS/Linux shell syntax or Git Bash/WSL on Windows:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5005/speak \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
  -d '{"text":"Hello from AskRex","user":"default"}' \
  --output speech.wav
```

### OpenClaw / Rex Tool Server

The OpenClaw tool server (`rex-tool-server`) requires an API key. Generate one with:

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:REX_TOOL_API_KEY = "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
$env:REX_ALLOW_PLAINTEXT_CREDENTIAL_FALLBACK = "1"
rex-tool-server  # explicit unpackaged legacy/operator mode; packaged builds reject this
```

macOS/Linux shell:

```bash
export REX_TOOL_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
export REX_ALLOW_PLAINTEXT_CREDENTIAL_FALLBACK=1
rex-tool-server  # explicit unpackaged legacy/operator mode; no production fallback
```

Health endpoints with curl, using macOS/Linux shell syntax or Git Bash/WSL on Windows:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5005/health/live
curl http://127.0.0.1:18790/health/live
```

## Docker

Run AskRex in a container. See [docs/docker.md](docs/docker.md) for build, run, and GPU options.

## Memory

AskRex stores per-user voice and conversation profiles under `Memory/`. See [docs/memory.md](docs/memory.md) for profile format and voice cloning notes.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues: missing ffmpeg, CUDA driver mismatches, wake word not triggering. See [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md) for solutions.

## Development

Python checks, after activating the virtual environment on any platform:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev,test]"
pytest
ruff check .
black --check .
mypy .
```

Electron checks on Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
cd gui
npm.cmd run typecheck
npm.cmd run build
```

Electron checks on macOS/Linux:

```bash
cd gui
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

The current coverage threshold in `pyproject.toml` is 75 percent. Test markers include `unit`, `integration`, `slow`, `audio`, `gpu`, `network`, `asyncio`, `anyio`, and `smoke`. The skipped-test inventory is maintained in [docs/testing/SKIPPED-TESTS-INVENTORY.md](docs/testing/SKIPPED-TESTS-INVENTORY.md).

Renderer IPC policy — raw `fetch('/api/...')` calls in `gui/src/` are blocked by CI:

- `scripts/check_no_renderer_api_fetch.py` — guard script (run via `python scripts/check_no_renderer_api_fetch.py`)
- `gui/src/ALLOWED_API_FETCHES.txt` — allowlist of exempted call sites; all renderer `/api/` fetches have been migrated to IPC (US-003 through US-010); the allowlist is now empty and any new raw fetch will fail CI

## Security

- Keep secrets in the OS-backed credential vault; do not put them in `.env`, JSON config, documentation, logs, or packaged resources. Plaintext environment reads exist only as an explicit unpackaged legacy/operator mode.
- `rex-speak-api` requires `REX_SPEAK_API_KEY`.
- `rex-tool-server` requires `REX_TOOL_API_KEY` for tool invocation.
- The GUI backend's log endpoints (`/api/logs/stream`, `/api/logs/download`) require a `REX_PROXY_TOKEN` Bearer token and redact home-directory paths from served log content. See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).
- Approval-gated high-risk actions, such as WooCommerce writes and remote PC commands, require explicit confirmation flows.
- Canonical tools declare a risk class (`safe` / `sensitive` / `prohibited`) in the tool registry; `sensitive` tools return `confirmation_required` instead of executing until explicitly confirmed, and `prohibited` tools are always denied. Home Assistant mutations additionally use signed, single-use, action-bound confirmation tokens. See [docs/tools.md](docs/tools.md).
